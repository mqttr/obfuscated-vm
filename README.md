# Obfuscated Virtual Machine
Created for my semester project for Malware Analysis in Spring '25 taught by a fantastic teacher at my (soon-to-be) Alma Mater.

This project is designed to make it easy to see and to replicate my semester project to make it difficult to detect from within a virtualised environment said virtualised environment


This is a little thrown together. I plan on improving it in the future.

Also check out my other project: https://github.com/mqttr/showcase-vmexit. It's related to this project showcasing the power of vm exit.
